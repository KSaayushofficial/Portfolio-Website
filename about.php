        <div class="about-content">
            <p>Welcome to my corner of the web! I’m Aayush, a passionate web developer with a knack for turning complex problems into elegant solutions. With a background in both front-end and back-end development, I specialize in creating responsive, user-friendly websites and applications that not only look great but perform seamlessly. My toolkit includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a range of modern frameworks and libraries, but my real strength lies in my ability to adapt and learn new technologies. When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring the latest tech trends, honing my design skills, or working on personal projects. Let’s connect and turn your digital vision into reality!</p>
